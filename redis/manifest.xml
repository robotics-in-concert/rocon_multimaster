  <description brief="patched code for redis-py">

     The python redis client has a minor issue - it hangs on ctrl-c.
     This is a locally patched version that we can use directly until it
     is patched upstream.

     Note - this package has to be named 'redis' so we can conveniently
     import as if we were using the python-redis package.
